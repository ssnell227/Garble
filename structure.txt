-a turn based word game based on scrabble
-a client-side gui that consists of a grid and tiles drawn in canvas
-a server that stores the values displayed on the two players' grids as the game progresses
-connected to a dictionary api that checks if the word is valid

to build:
CLIENT
-a collection of total scrabble tiles for the game
-a function that pulls tiles randomly from the collection of total tiles and adds them to the
user's tile set, deleting the tiles from the original collection
	-it should automatically replenish as the tiles are used on 'submit'
-an interactive grid that allows users to type in the values from their tile sets into
appropriate empty spots in the grid
	-the user that plays first must play a word in spots that intersect the middle spot
	of the board
-a submit function that requests for the tile placements to be pushed to the server's game
board and 'published' for both players to see
	-only the player whose turn it is should be able to use the submit button effectively
	-the tiles that the player submits must intersect previous played words and any
	adjacent tiles must create a complete word
		-the words, on submit, will be checked against a dictionary api that checks
		only for presence
		-if not present in the dictionary, the words will not be commited and the
		user will be sent a message saying to submit a proper word

SERVER
-a 'master' game board object that stores the letter values for each location on the
game board as well as their multiplyer values
-a function that totals the letter values from each word submitted and multiplies it by any
multiplyer locations the word was placed on, adding the total word score to the appropriate
player's total score
-a function that emits the values from the master game board to the associated tiles on both
players screens after the server accepts a submit
-some sort of endgame?
